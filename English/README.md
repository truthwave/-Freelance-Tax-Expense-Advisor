## 💬 Example Usage

### Example Question ①:
```

Can I expense the cafe costs from a meeting?

```

#### GPT's Answer:
> ✅ It may be eligible as a meeting expense.  
> Keep these points in mind:  
> - It must be an actual meeting, not individual use  
> - Keep notes with the date, purpose, and names of attendees  
> - Keep the receipt and write notes on the back for peace of mind

---

### Example Question ②:
```

Please explain the difference between blue-form and white-form tax returns.

```

#### GPT's Answer:
> ✅ Key differences between blue-form and white-form tax returns:

| Item       | Blue-form Tax Return | White-form Tax Return |
|------------|------------- -----------|----------------|
| Benefits      | Up to ¥650,000 deduction, etc.   | No deductions       |
| Bookkeeping   | Double-entry bookkeeping required         | Simplified bookkeeping allowed |
| Loss carryforward   | Possible (for 3 years)          | Not possible           |

> Blue-form filing requires a bit more effort but is characterized by **significant tax savings**.
